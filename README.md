## 1. Introduction to Terraform  
  
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision datacenter infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. Terraform supports a multitude of cloud service providers, including Microsoft Azure.  
  
## 2. Setting Up Terraform  
  
Before you can use Terraform, you need to install it on your local machine. You can download Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and follow the [installation instructions](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) for your specific operating system.  
  
## 3. Writing a Basic Terraform Configuration File  
  
A Terraform configuration file defines what resources you want. You write it in a declarative language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). Here's an example of how a simple configuration file that creates an Azure Resource Group may look like:  
  
```hcl  
provider "azurerm" {  
  version = "~>2.0"  
  features {}  
}  
  
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {  
  name     = "example-resources"  
  location = "West Europe"  
}
